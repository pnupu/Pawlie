# Pawlie: Your Personalized Companion

## About Pawlie

Pawlie was made in Junction 2023. Pawlie is designed to tackle a significant problem - the lack of good active habits in young individuals, impacting over 200 million people worldwide. Our solution focuses on enhancing cognitive and social skills through a gamified approach, making life happier and healthier.

### Problem We Address

More than 200 million people suffer from reduced cognitive and social skills due to a lack of good active habits built during their youth. Our mission is to change this by leveraging the most precious non-renewable resource: our bodies.

### Our Solution: Pawlie

Pawlie is the worldâ€™s first truly personalized companion. It combines Pokemon Go-like activities, where users collect rare items, with continuous activity measurements from smartphones and wearables. This unique blend creates a gamified lifestyle app that fosters deep bonds between users and their Pawlie characters.

**Marketing Highlight**: "Pawlie: Your journey to a happier, healthier life starts here!"
